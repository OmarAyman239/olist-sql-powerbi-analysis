📊 Olist E-Commerce Sales Analysis

SQL + Power BI End-to-End Business Intelligence Project

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Brazilian Olist E-Commerce dataset to build a complete Business Intelligence solution using SQL and Power BI.

The objective was to transform raw transactional data into a structured analytical model and develop an interactive dashboard that provides business insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends.

The project covers the full BI workflow:

Data transformation in SQL

Data modeling (fact & dimension structure)

Importing structured views into Power BI

Creating DAX measures and KPIs

Designing an interactive dashboard

🗄️ Data Modeling (SQL Layer)

All transformations were performed in SQL to prepare optimized analytical views.

Key SQL Components:

Fact Table

fact_sales — transactional sales data

Dimension Tables

dim_customer_enriched

dim_customer_value_segments

dim_date

SQL Techniques Used:

Complex joins across multiple tables

Aggregations and grouping

Window functions

Customer value segmentation logic

Creation of reusable SQL views

Data cleaning and transformation

The final structure follows a Star Schema model to ensure efficient reporting in Power BI.

📊 Power BI Implementation

The SQL views were imported directly into Power BI to maintain a clean separation between transformation and visualization layers.

Power BI Work Included:

Data model relationships (fact → dimensions)

Creation of DAX measures

Time intelligence calculations

KPI design and interactive filtering

Dashboard layout optimization

Example DAX Measures:

Total Revenue
